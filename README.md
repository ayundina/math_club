# Hi, kids!
This repo is dedicated to a math club at Codam. We love math. We want to advance our knowledge, grow together, and inspire each other.
# Meeting structure
The idea of the meetings is to get **hands on problems**. We are interested in math related to **Data Science**, **Analytics**, **Computer Graphics** and **Algorithms**. Every day covers **simple-to-advanced levels** of a single mathematics area - **Linear Algebra**, **Probability**, **Statistics**, **Calculus**, **Trigonometry** or **Discrete Mathematics**. As an addition, we encourage **knowledge sharing**. If someone has a breakthrough and finally grasped a new concept, we encourage them to share the insights and details of the obtained understanding. If someone got stuck on a problem, we encourage them to share the pain and get our heads together to crack it.
